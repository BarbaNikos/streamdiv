\section{Problem Definition}
\indent As far as different dimensions of the problem are concerned, ranking is
considered as a set of user-defined properties that are either attached to
incoming tuples (annotate), or are used for filtering out tuples. Turning
to the diversity operator, we abstract it as a stateful operator, with time-
based sliding windows. The operator's frequency of result production
can be one of the following: (i) a temporary snapshot of the most diverse
tuples in the current time-window produced every time a tuple is received,
(ii) a set of the most diverse tuples among all the tuples that have been
received in a user-defined epoch. In the latter case, we consider how
many tuples are replaced and which ones every time a new tuple arrives.
For the former case, we consider a static approach (a pre-defined fraction
p of the tuples are replaced after every epoch), and a dynamic one (the
fraction p of the tuples replaced is proportional to the $\delta$ in diversity gained
compared to the replacement fraction of the previous epoch). As regards
to replacement policy, we have the alternatives of random replacement,
and least recently tuple received replacement.
