\section{Introduction}

Data creation and collection only continues to increase, leaving a large burden on analysts to come up with a way to quickly and efficiently comb through the data to locate trends and correlations.  There tends to be a focus on data-specific approaches with frameworks that work well for certain kinds of data (but not well on others CITATION NEEDED).  There also is a need in data analysis to provide relevant but diverse data points as a digest of the full data set.  Several offline versions have been created \cite{Ge:2015:PD:2795218.2795224} CITATIONS NEEDED, but lack the speed to work in a streaming environment.  We present StreamDiv, a streaming framework built on top of a previously developed diversity system for offline database systems, PrefDiv\cite{Ge:2015:PD:2795218.2795224}, to provide queriers of a data streaming systems a top-$k$ set that is most relevant and diverse, adding recency as a possible influence on the digested set.
