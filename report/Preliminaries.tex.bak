\section{Preliminaries}
Both diversity and relevance have been explored to quite some depth in within the broader context of \textit{representative data exploration} techniques. The diversity of a set of tuples is usually defined using a distance measure between pairs of tuples. In the case of numerical attributes, this could be the Euclidean distance between the data points, whereas in other cases, this could be a function specific to the type of data we are dealing with. Formally, let $d(t_i,t_j)$ denote the distance between two tuples $t_i$ and $t_j$. The diversity of a set $S$ containing $p$ tuples is defined as 
\begin{equation}diversity(S) = \end{equation}
However, most of the literature focuses on the problem of diversification and relevancy in the framework of traditional databases, where the data is stored on a disk and all of the data is available to the representative data extraction algorithm as it looks through the entire haystack to pick out a small \textit{representative} subset. The luxury of
